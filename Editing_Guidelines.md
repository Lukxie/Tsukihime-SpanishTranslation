# Editing guidelines

This document provides an outline of some of the broad guidelines and
specific rules to be followed when localizing the Tsukihime remake.

As a general rule, the translated text should strive to retain all meaning
present in the Japanese original, while still being rendered in such a way that
it reads like natural English prose. These two goals are naturally in some
tension, and finer decisions should be made on a case by case basis to ensure
that tone, dramatic pacing of sentence structure, and other concerns are
appropriate to the context at hand.

## Hard and fast rules

- When a sentence starts with a 'stutter' (e.g. 「そ、そんなコト...」), then the
  duplicated translated sentence should keep case (e.g. N-No, that's not...).
- When translating active speech (voiced lines), the text should be enclosed in
  double quotes
  - > "This is someone actively speaking a voiced line"
- When translating active speech that contains quoted references, the inner
  quotes should be single quotes (')
  - > "This is someone speaking an actively voiced line referencing 'that' thing"
- When translating passive speech (narration that references a previous phrase or
  voiced line), the quoted text should be in single quotes
  - > When I think about the time they said 'this is someone actively speaking', I blah blah
  - Note that if passive text contains single quote characters, those characters
    remain as single quotes
    - > When I think about the time they said 'this is someone talking about 'that' thing', I blah blah
- For 'lead in' or 'lead out' of sentences (e.g.  "―――Nii-san," or "this time―――"),
  use 3 CJK dashes not ASCII dashes, since the game will combine the unicode ones into a single solid line.
- Abruptly cut-off sentences should also use 3 CJK dashes (e.g. "What are you talking ab―――")A.
- For in-sentence em-dashes, use 2 CJK dashes (e.g. "this tea――it's incredible!").
- Do NOT use CJK space characters (u3000), as these render at a different width than normal ascii space characters
- Do NOT use CJK ellipsis (…), it renders vertically justified. Replace with three ASCII dots.
- When ruby text is used, YOU MUST playtest the changes and add spaces to justify the text correctly.
  - The text renders too far to the right by default - append spaces to the ruby text to shift it left
  - The text renders very close together - for each character to display, insert an extra ' ' after it ('real' spaces become two spaces) to expand the text.
- When glueing lines, the '#' must be attached to the _preceding_ line in the event of a space.
  - Correct: `This is the first line.# This is the second line`
  - WRONG: `This is the first line. #This is the second line`
- In all sentences, the word 'anyway' should be used instead of 'anyways'
- All choices should be prefaced with a single space (e.g. `C:> Choice one`) so that choices beginning with ... are not merged with the choice numbering dots
- All choice options should start with a capital letter
- The general audience for this VN is expected to have at least passing familiarity with Japanese honorifics, and so common suffixes should be preserved. This includes -kun, -chan, -san, -sama and -sensei. Rarer honorifics, such as 氏, are to be localized as Mr. / Ms.
- Numbers should be written out only if they are short enough to be a single word. That means:
  - All numbers <= 19 are written out
  - All multiples of 10 up to 100 are written out
  - 100, 1000 are written out
  - Explicit comparative 'scientific' contexts should use numbers
  - The Twenty-Seven DAA is a title and should be written out

## Specific characters

### Shiki(s)

When translating a particular reference to a Shiki, format the name accordingly:
- 志貴: Shiki
- 四季: SHIKI
- シキ: _Shiki_

### Noel

Noel tries to sound *young* and *appealing*, and at the same time a bit provocative, sometimes seducing. To convey this character, we will use a vocabular and grammar that can be sometimes a bit slangish or colloquial (e.g. "ain't", "Nah", etc.), we'll do heavy elision of words when necessary, but not too frequently (e.g. "y'know", etc.) and a bit provocative general tone.

**<u>Sample sentence</u>**: "Huh? What's up with this atmosphere? Everyone suddenly froze up.. What's that, I'm a Basilisk woman? # Nah, the metaphor ain't clear, is it. Erm, in proper japanese, I'd be that TV haunting girl? But Sensei's name isn't Sadako y'know" (*filename 02_00_ARC02_1_1, page 6, line 2941*)

### Arihiko

Arihiko is a thug, but he's the usual cliché of the goofy thug with a heart of gold helping the protagonist. In order to convey this and not to overstep Noel's speech pattern, we will use in his lines funny or weird idioms/expressions (they can be a bit old for example, or he can have an off-beat style), but a the same time some cursing ("what the hell", etc).

**Sample sentence**: "Tohno's picking up chicks? What the hell is going on? I thought you weren't interested in 'em." (*original VN*)

### Dr. Arach

Dr. Arach is a complete weirdo, and something of a *mad biologist*. Conveying her speech is probably the most difficult, but here are some guiding principles: she expresses herself in a very bombastic way, i.e. using exaggerations and a refined vocabulary ("Oh, sublime sugar!"), and sometimes she does biological/medical comparisons, and in this case we have to make these parts overly serious. The idea is to induce burlesque/surreal humor by creating a mismatch between the technical parts and the bombastic parts.

**Sample sentence:** "Oooh, sublime sugar! You're pervading all five of my senses! You're even making my uterus and my ovaries melt.. I feel it coming! Haah.. Thanks for the meaaal!" (*filename 02_00_ARC02_1B, page 39, line 2802*)

Arach has many different designators. For consistency, use:
阿良句先生 - Arach-sensei
阿良句医師 - Dr. Arach
阿良句博士 - Prof. Arach
阿良句女史 - Ms. Arach
阿良句氏 - Ms. Arach (-shi is not a widely recognized honorific)

### Ruby/furigana/gloss

1) **The normal use:** The ruby indicates the standard pronunciation of the word
Example: 琥珀さんは着物の<袖|そで>から、こそっと携帯電話を取りだした
そで is the standard pronunciation of 袖
**EN:** Disregard it entirely.

2) **The “different-but-close” use:** The ruby is a word that is different from what’s under but only slightly different in meaning, giving a nuance but not a whole different meaning.
Example: 遠野邸は<総|ま><耶|ち>の端に位置し
総耶 is pronounced Souya, the city in which Tsukihime takes place. The ruby is まち meaning “city”.
Other examples: <報道|ニュース>, <男子組|なかまたち>, <槙久|オヤジ> , <棘|パワー>, <思考|あたま>, <幻|ゆ><覚|め>, <筋力|ちから>, <彫刻品|オブジェ>, <怪物|ヴローヴ>
**EN:** Take one, either the ruby and what’s glossed (what’s under the ruby) but we won’t keep two words in English.

3) **The “too-important” use:** The ruby really gives an additional meaning to what’s glossed. Obviously, there is some personal interpretation to whether a gloss in English is necessary or not. But some cases should be clear enough.
Example: <獲物|おんな> (<prey|woman>)
**EN:** You can keep the ruby here. Sometimes, it’s possible to write explicitly the ruby and the glossed word in the sentence. In case of doubt especially if you’re first to do the file, keep the ruby, the various proofreadings will decide at a later point.
Note: There is also the emphasis dot, things like: <ひ|・><と|・><り|・><だ|・><け|・><世|・><界|・><が|・><違|・><う|・>. This is a way in Japanese to put emphasis, similar to bold or italics in English.

Overall, ruby whatever its purpose is something very familiar to a Japanese reader. It doesn’t exist in English but the game engine still gives us the possibility to use it. It can be useful but will necessarily be seen as intrusive in English. So we should keep it to a minimum.

One last thing, it is also possible to add ruby in the English translation where it wasn’t in Japanese. Use your discretion, but it can be an inventive way to get out of formulations that are too convoluted in English while retaining a nuance you don’t want to lose.

### Time Format

Whenever time is mentioned in the script, it should be written in the o'clock format.

For example
- > "The night just turned past nine o'clock"

However, if the time has minutes, then leave it as it is.

For example
- > "The time is 7:30 AM"
- > "The time is 6:33 PM"

### Ellipses

When ellipses are used after a word, leave a space before typing the next word.
- Example:
    - > Everything suddenly froze in place... etc etc

When ellipses are used at the beginning of a sentence, do not leave a space.
- Example:
    - > "...I see"

### Special Terms

The game contains a number of special terms that should be translated with care
and consistency. A full dictionary of these terms, their context, and their
capitalization rules can be found on the main
